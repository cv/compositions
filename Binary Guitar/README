== Binary Guitar

Turns a Guitar Hero USB controller into a real instrument. Mac only.

You'll need:

- PureData [1]
- Quartz Composer [2]
- MidiPipe [3]
- Xbox 360 Controller Driver [4]
- GarageBand or other software that understands MIDI

To run:

- Install everything

- Open PD to MIDI.mipi in MidiPipe

- Open Binary Guitar.pd in PureData

- Go to Pure Data / Preferences / MIDI settings... and point the MIDI inputs and outputs to MidiPipe

- Open Binary Guitar.qtz in Quartz Composer

- Connect the X-Plorer Guitar. If everything's working correctly, the Quartz Composer viewer should be black (rather than a checkered pattern)

- Open GarageBand, select your favourite virual instrument.

- Rock on!
